<li><a href="1.html">1</a>: Metapleural gland opening provided with conspicuous guard hairs; in side view the scutum does not overhang the pronotum but shares with it the anterior thoracic convexity</li>
<li><a href="2.html">2</a>: HW distinctly less than the width of the thorax just anterior to the regulae</li>
<li><a href="3.html">3</a>: Length of terminal segment of maxillary palp exeeeding 0.1 X the HW, even if only slightly</li>
<li><a href="4.html">4</a>: When viewed as above, the median third of the anterior border of the median clypeal lobe convex or angulate, never flat or emarginate; the posterior basal tooth, with rare exceptions, always aligned with the adjacent teeth of the masticatory border; when it is offset, this condition occurs in a minority of the individuals of the nest series and usually only on one mandible in any individual, and secondary offset teeth are never present on the basal border</li>
<li><a href="5.html">5</a>: When viewed with the mandibles opened and the head held in perfect full face, the anterior border of the median clypeal lobe is angulate, with two straight or very feebly convex sides meeting in a blunt point at the midline; in a large part of any nest series the penultimate basal tooth is distinctly reduced in size relative to the two flanking teeth (North American species only)</li>
<li><a href="6.html">6</a>: Scapes and tibiae lacking 'standing hairs</li>
