It is very variable in length and thickness, but when present in any form the petiole is termed pedunculate. When a peduncle is absent, so that the node or scale of the petiole immediately follows the articulation with the propodeum, the petiole is termed sessile. If an extremely short or poorly defined peduncle occurs, the petiole is termed subsessile."
